-1. text_view: #get_window => #get_window_text_view
    but this is a special name mangling introduced by the binding
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

0. w#as_widget => w
   (thanks to methods always taking #class in input in place
   of class)

1. #show => #misc#show
2. #grab_default => #misc#grab_default

3. Separator/Box:
     #pack => #add
     #pack ~padding:5 => (fun w -> hbox#pack_start w false true (*~padding:*)5)
4. Notebook:
     #append_page w => #append_page w None
     #switch_page (fun i -> ..) => #switch_page (fun w i -> ..)
4. Table:
     #attach => Lablgtk3Compat.attach

5. AboutDialog:
     ~name => ~program_name
5. Table:
     ~columns => ~n_columns
     ~rows => ~n_rows
     ~row_spacings => ~row_spacing
     ~col_spacings => ~column_spacing
5. LinkButton:
     uri => ~uri
5. Dialog
    #vbox => #get_content_area
5. ScrolledWindow
    ~hpolicy => ~hscrollbar_policy

5.5 Dialogs used polymorphic variants in place of numbers;
    added Lablgtk3Compat.encode_decode (see spin.ml) as an
    half-baked solution

5.5. add_button_stock `OK `OK =>
     w#add_button (GtkStock.convert_id `OK) (encode `OK)
     (visible in spin.ml)

6. a window w is not a #container, but it can be casted to it
   (e.g. in example button.ml). It used to be a #container instead.
   The problem is due to #connect: window signals inherit from container
   signals, but a cast is required. How did it work without before?

7. adjustments only at the low level: add #as_adjustment where there should
   be no one (e.g. counter.ml)
7. text_buffer only at the low level: add #as_text_buffer where there should
   be no one (e.g. gioredirect.ml)

8. about.ml: run no longer takes a () (visible in dialog.ml)
8. ProgressBar: #pulse no longer takes a ()

9. window#event#connect => window#connect

10. GtkButtonProps.Button.S.activate => Button.S.activate

11. Assistant: #npage returns an option now
11. Action: #get_widget returns an option now

12. GFile.filter => FileFilterG.file_filter
13. toolbar ~style => toolbar ~toolbar_style
    toolbar#insert f => toolbar#insert f ~-1
14. window ~position => ~window_position

============= TO TEST ==================
1. output of button.exe: is it the expected one?
   same for counter.exe: maybe wrong default somewhere?
2. output of about.exe: it seems strange
3. output of assistant.exe: it is correct?
4. assistant_tutorial: is it working properly?
5. cgets.ml: what should it do?
6. signal_override.ml: what should it do?
7. dcalendar.ml: test after implementation finished
8. nihongo.ml: what does it do with colors? Not working it seems

============= TODO (XXX) ==================
1. radiobutton.ml: #get_group
3. button.ml: ~use_mnemonic ~stock
4. about.ml: ~authors
8. seppala.ml: add_accel_group type mismatch
9. expander.ml: type mismatch (used Obj.magic)
9. events2.ml: type mismatch (used Obj.magic)
11. dcalendar.ml: (APIStruct) isn't implemented yet
    events2.ml: (APIStruct) isn't implemented yet
    events.ml: (APIStruct) isn't implemented yet
13. kaimono.ml: FileChooserDialog (interface not implemented?)
14. Many XXX in Lablgtk3Compat.factory
15. nihongo.ml: type mismatch
16. application/browser.ml:
     - FileChooser?
     - #create_tag

GText.{view,buffer} ==> ??? (several files in too_hard_to_port)
socket.ml: what the hell is this example trying to do?

============= TOO HARD ==================
1. action.ml: methods throwing exceptions not implemented yet

3. Additional constructors not implemented (e.g. Buttong.new_with_mnemonic)

   visible in expander.ml
8. (*XXX BUGGED: it should encode enum GtkResponseType using numbers from -1 to -12
and the same used by C because "MessageDialogG.message_dialog ~buttons" expects
this behaviour. Moreover one cannot add the buttons later to MessageDialogs*)
   visible in dialog_thread.ml



============= Notes ==================
1. Widget.size_params is an exeption w.r.t. Widget.make_params
   Consequence:use ~width in place of ~width_request.
   Why??
